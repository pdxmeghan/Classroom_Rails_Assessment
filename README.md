#####Classroom is a Ruby on Rails project that keeps track of teachers, courses, and students within a database. Limitations: At this point a teacher can have many classes, and a class can have many students, but a student cannot have many classes, and a class cannot have many teachers.

###To Use:
Gems required in this program:
* rails
* pg
* sass-rails
* sqlite3
* sass-rails
* uglifier
* coffee-rails
* jquery-rails
* turbolinks
* sdoc

* better_errors

* quiet_assets
* rspec-rails
* shoulda-matchers

Clone the repository, run $ rake db:create, run $ rails server, and open localhost:3000/teachers in your browser.
